# Overview 
A recently started real estate brokerage operating in Helsinki faces a problem in their every day business. 
The price estimations of the apartments is being done intuitively, which requires human resources and has resulted into inaccurate predictions.

They hire a data-analyst to build them a model, which can be used to estimate the house prices. 
In their requirements:
1) The model must be accurate enough to provide benefits at the first place
2) The model must be intuitive enough to be understood by all the shareholders (client, salesmen, buyer, management)

First in this post, we will discuss about the business incentives related to such a task. 
Second, we will build a multiple linear regression model using python with secondary data sources. 
Finally, the model is visualized with Tableau, which can be further used in business related illustrations. 

Let's hop into it!

# Business incentive
The real estate industry of Helsinki has been booming for a while.[^2]

- demand is clearly increasing, which pressures prices to come up
- the prices increase and also the market share
- when theres a bigger cake, there also comes more hungry mouths trying to get their share
- this has also directed the client for the industry

- the more intense the competition is, the more is needed for the company to find its fit role in the market
- traditionally this means optimizing the processes, costs etc to end up with bigger margins
- if the company cannot adapt to the environment, being comparable worse in their role than peers, the company is slowly heering to death

- thus the client needs the predictive model to estimate the house prices faster and with better accuracy than intuitive
- but what this actually does for the firm position?
 0) it decreases the cost of salesmen entering to the building and doing cognitive task of evaluating the price themselves
 1) the estimation gives a reference which can be used to increase margins (house pricing can be strategically used to buy and sell houses)
 2) the estimation works as "mustaa valkoisella" which can be illustrated to the buyers and sellers, to reduce risks of being exploited (we tend to believe graphs more than korulauseet)
 3) the model can be exposed into communication channels to provide inbound flow of customers and brand increase

these factors therefore can improve the competitive position of the firm, and improve its adaptiviness to the environment

Enough of the business, lets get to the data wrangling.

# Multiple linear regression

### Selection of the model

pros
- multiple linear model is fit when the relation between indepentent and dependent variable is expected to be linear
- you want to know how dependent variable is affected by other variables, here our dependent variable is price 
- intuitive to understand
- finds the most important indepentent variables 

cons
- if the relationship is not linear, the validity suffers
- overly simplified
- correlation is not causation

### The data sources

- we have assumption that the housing prices a lineary correlated with the neliöt, makuuhuoneiden määrä, keskineliöt alueella jne
- However, this kind of data is actually kind of hard to find in a format ready to be analyzed. Three options are identified:
1) tilastokeskus offers some data about houses in certain area code
2) omakoti jne provides information about display prices and details of houses which could be acquired through web crawling, but the site is crawling-protected
3) asuntotiedot.fi provides a website of data, which seems to offer the highest and most reliable data for the done deals. 

For this reason we select the options 1 & 3, and merge those to find a base of variables to examine further.

Unfortunately asuntotiedot.fi do not have an option to download the data as csv-file or from open API.

To overcome this, we must webcrawl to collect this data.
