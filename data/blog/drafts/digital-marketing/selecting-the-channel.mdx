What is customer experience?

Practically everything can be brought down to costs and benefits.

Economical, cognitive, emotional, social. You name it. 

Website referrals and online galleries: reducement of risks.

Using google maps for navigation, reducement of cognitive costs.

Telling customers of new hours: providing information for people of regular hours + informing of abnormal hours.
