## Overview

Qualitative 
Qualitative data is essentially any descriptive information that you can't put a number to. This could be peopleâ€™s opinions about a new product, or the sentiment and language people use on social media when talking about a brand.

Quantitative
Quantitative data is anything that can be numerically measured, like the number of people visiting a website or the amount of sales a site makes in a month.
