Essentials of digital marketing

Google Market Finder can show Matt that there is high search traffic on vintage record terms from Portugal. To Matt this may imply that a lot of people are looking for records out there.

Low competition on search ads in Portugal would mean Matt wouldn’t be up against lots of other vintage record sellers. Google Keyword Planner is a useful tool for looking at the volume of search ads.

If people in Portugal are looking at his website already, then Matt can be fairly sure that there would be potential buyers. Google Analytics can help Matt keep track of things like who’s looking at his website and what pages they look at most and adapt his strategy as needed.
